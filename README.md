Script Name : StockScript() - by Ryan MacFarlane
This Script file loops through the 'Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx' Excel workbook and provides helpful information (such as Yearly Change, Percent Change, and Total Volume) for each stock present.  For each of the three years (provided on different tabs) it will also find and display the "greatest % increase" stock and "greatest % decrease" stock, as well as display the stock with the highest overall trading volume.  It also helpfully highlights each change in red/green/or white for a positive/negative/neutrel result, respectively.

Screenshots have also been provided, showing the results of this script for each tab - 2018/2019/2020.

If you have any questions - please feel free to reach out to me at 'atlis34@yahoo.com'.

Thank you!
Ryan MacFarlane
